Build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.

Conversion type:

* Temperature conversion: users choose Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
* Length conversion: users choose meters, kilometers, feet, yards, or miles.
* Time conversion: users choose seconds, minutes, hours, or days.
* Volume conversion: users choose milliliters, liters, cups, pints, or gallons.

App flow's sample for length conversion:

* A segmented control for meters, kilometers, feet, yard, or miles, for the input unit.
* A second segmented control for meters, kilometers, feet, yard, or miles, for the output unit.
* A text field where users enter a number.
* A text view showing the result of the conversion.

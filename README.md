# 100-Days-of-SwiftUI

SwiftUI learn basic challenge from [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

## Rules
Do the following **every day** for **100 days**:
* Spend **one hour**<sup>*</sup> reading/watching SwiftUI tutorials, or writing Swift code.
* Update progress in repo **documentation**.

<sup>*</sup>Limiting time spent is meant to avoid burnt-out, dicipline and consistency is preffered for long term gain.
